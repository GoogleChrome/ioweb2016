This session explains how you can use the ExoPlayer streaming media library to help provide your users with a great media experience. The talk provides an overview of the ExoPlayer's design, and highlights the advantages of ExoPlayer over other libraries such as MediaPlayer.\n\nThe ExoPlayer provides many sophisticated features such as Dynamic adaptive streaming over HTTP (DASH), SmoothStreaming and Common Encryption. It's designed to be easy to customize and extend, and many components can be replaced with custom implementations. Because ExoPlayer is a library that you include in your application, it can be easily updated along with your app.\n\nAfter attending this talk you'll understand how to integrate ExoPlayer into your application. If you are using it to replace MediaPlayer, this can be a quick and simple integration. However, you'll also come away with an understanding of the design and inner workings of ExoPlayer, including how to wire up ExoPlayer instances using custom components to satisfy the most demanding performance and UX requirements, as well as take full advantage of the sophisticated features provided by the player.",
